This project focuses on analyzing sales, customer, and product data using only SQL. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights by applying advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, conditional logic, and NULL handling.
The analysis answers key business questions related to revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
The dataset consists of three main logical entities:

Sales data – transactional records including order dates, quantities, and revenue

Customer data – demographic and behavioral attributes

Product data – product categories, pricing, and identifiers

These entities were joined and analyzed to create a complete business view.
Total and cumulative revenue

Average order value

Customer lifetime value (CLV)

Retention-related indicators

Product contribution to revenue

Sales growth over time
